#                 SETTINGS.conf File
# ----------------------------------------------------
# ====================================================

# This file will help you set the variables for Odyssey's 5 main scripts. 
# Note that some of these variables may not need to be changed as they are already set to various programs' recommended defaults. 
	# Changing these variables are thus optional and labeled as: "(OPTIONAL)"
# However, some of these variables (such as reference paths, working directory, and GWAS and Imputation Project Names) must be set by the user for Odyssey to function
	# Changing these variables are thus required and labeled as: "(REQUIRED)"
# Variables are listed in order of appearance and also under the script they appear in (although some are referenced more than once in several scripts)
	# In this way you may choose to fill out the variables a little at a time instead of all at once
	# If you choose to fill out Settings.conf little by little, make sure you do not run a script for which you have not filled out the necessary (REQUIRED) variables


# ===============================================================================
# ========================== Configuration Variables ============================
# ===============================================================================

# Setting up Odyssey is as easy as installing-running Singularity. Odyssey can also be run without Odyssey, however, this is not the recommended setup. Please follow the configuration instructions and pick your configuration options. Once that is complete type your configuration option in the setup variable below:


# How did you setup Odyssey? (Choose: 'One' or 'Two') (REQUIRED)
	# If you setup Odyssey to incorporate Singularity -- Option #1 -- then type 'One':
	# If you setup Odyssey independently of Singularity -- Option #2 -- then type 'Two':
		OdysseySetup="One";

# ===============================================================================
# =============================== Core Variables ================================
# ===============================================================================


	# Set Your Paths (i.e. specify where you put the Odyssey Folder on your system): (REQUIRED)
                singularityBinPath="/usr/local/bin"
                dataPath="/jumbo/WorkingDir/B21-012/Data/Raw/HGDP_EuroImputedSex"
		
#----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#              High Performance Cluster (HPC) Control Variables: 
#----------------------------------------------------------------------------		

	# Are you using a HPS (High Performance System) that utilizes a job handler?
		# If you specify "T" then a PBS header will be included on Phasing, Imputation, and GWAS analysis scripts
		# If you specify "F" then only a Bash shebang will be included on Phasing, Imputation, and GWAS analysis scripts 
			HPS_Submit="F";
	
	
	# If you set HPS_Submit="F" you may skip the remaining variables in this section:
			
	# Enter Your Email to get Notifications from your HPC: (OPTIONAL)
	#	Email="@";	
	
	# Does your system utilize Lustre Stripped Directories? (OPTIONAL)
		# Lustre stripping helps the file directories on HPS to prevent from being filled by distributing the files between harddrives
		# This is a good practice to use if available since it prevents "drive-full" errors
		# If you don't know what this is or your system doesn't utilize this feature you can safely ignore this option
		# Boolean Specify (T/F):
			LustreStrip="F";


# ===============================================================================
# ========================= Imputation Project Variables ========================
# ===============================================================================


	# Set Imputation Project Name: (REQUIRED)
	# This is the name that will identify the imputation project (by setting directory and file names) throughout the phasing and imputation processes
	# For example: "ImputationRun1"
	# NOTE: The Imputation Project Name must be a continuous string (i.e. do not include spaces)
		BaseName="ADAPT";
	# NOTE ON FILE NAMING: Odyssey automatically detects the input Plink files. However, using special characters and punctuation will likely cause Odyssey's find function to not work properly. Therefore, avoid using any non-alphanumeric in the name for input file. In addition, all Plink files (.fam/.bim/.bed/.log) must have the same name (minus the unique file extension)



# ================================================================================
# ========================== DataPrep Module Variables ===========================
# ================================================================================

	# Running the BCFTools +fixref add-in is highly recommended so that the Plink formatted input .bed/.bim/.fam files will match the imputation reference -- and thus reduce the chance of imputation errors.
		#NOTE: Deposit data in ./0_DataPrepModule/PLACE_DATA_2B_FIXED_HERE/ folder to begin. The name of the .bed/.bim/.fam files irrelevant as long as there are no other Plink files also in the folder
	
	# Do you want to use the Fixref plugin to prep your data for imputation? (Boolean: T/F) (OPTIONAL)

		# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		# Do you need to download the Reference to Prep the Genotype Files with BCFTools? You only need to do this once (Boolean: T/F) (OPTIONAL)
			# NOTE: As references are continually being updated you may want to check the links to make sure they are still current and/or the reference you desire.
			# The references files are:
				# Ref Genome: ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/technical/reference/human_g1k_v37.fasta.gz
				# Annotation for Ref Genome:ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/snp/organisms/human_9606_b150_GRCh37p13/VCF/All_20170710.vcf.gz

		#Execute STEP 2?: Aligns BCF File to the Reference Annotation and fixes coordinate errors and allele mismatches with BCFtools (Boolean: T/F) (OPTIONAL)
			DataPrepStep2="F";
	
		#Execute STEP 3?: Sorts the reference-aligned BCF output and convert it back into Plink format for phasing -- also removes positional duplicates if they exist (Boolean: T/F) (OPTIONAL)
			DataPrepStep3="F";
	
		#Save DataPrep Intermediate Files?: Saves all the intermediate files for troubleshooting purposes instead of deleting them (Boolean: T/F) (OPTIONAL)
			# NOTE: If you are executing on a step-by-step basis, you should NOT remove the intermediate files	
			SaveDataPrepIntermeds="T"

	# Do you want to visualize your genomic data? (Boolean: T/F) (OPTIONAL)
		# The following R-based step will INTERACTIVELY walk you through data visualization through a series of prompts. Since this in an interactive process, this step should NOT be run in a non-interactive mode.
		
		# NOTE: This step performs analysis on a Plink .bed/.bim/.fam file located within ./1_Target/PLACE_NEW_PROJECT_TARGET_DATA_HERE/. Ideally, this step is run after running the previous BCFToolsFixRef step -- regardless of whether BCFTools was used to prep the data -- PerformFixref="T" -- or only positional duplicates were removed -- PerformFixref="F"
		
		# If T then an interactive R script will run allowing you to visualize the following:
			# --missingness of genotypes and individuals
			# --Heterozygosity rates
			# --Related Individuals
			
		# This step will also allow you to write individual ID numbers to an exclusion list that can be used later to exclude from analysis
		
		# If F then this step will be skipped
			DataVisualization="F";
			
		# WARNING: THIS GRAPHICAL AND INTERACTIVE R-BASED STEP REQUIRES X11 TO BE CONFIGURED ON THE HOST AND REMOTE SYSTEM. IF YOU ARE RUNNING ODYSSEY LOCALLY THEN YOU MAY IGNORE THIS WARNING. IF YOU RUN INTO ERRORS YOU MAY CHOOSE TO TURN OFF X11 AS THE GRAPHS WILL STILL BE OUTPUT TO THE QC FOLDER
		# Use X11? This will allow you to interact with the script via visualizing graphs as they are plotted. See X11 Configuration Instructions in the Readme Folder. Setting X11 to false will still output plots to the QC-Visualization directory

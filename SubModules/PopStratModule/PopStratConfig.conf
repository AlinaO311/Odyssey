# Config.conf File
# -------------------

# This file will help you set the variables for the Pop-Strat Add-in Module scripts. 
# Note that some of these variables may not need to be changed as they are already set to various programs' recommended defaults. 
	# Changing these variables are thus optional and labeled as: "(OPTIONAL)"
# However, some of these variables (such as reference paths and PCA Analysis Names) must be set by the user for PopStrat to function
	# Changing these variables are thus required and labeled as: "(REQUIRED)"

# ======================================================================== Core Variables  ==================================================================================
# ===========================================================================================================================================================================

# Set Your Working Directory (i.e. specify where you put the Odyssey Folder on your system): (REQUIRED)
  # Please include a "/" on the end of your directory path as it will make the output syntax easier to read
	WorkingDir="/N/dc2/scratch/ryeller/Odyssey/";


# Specify the "Base" Name of your Reference Dataset (don't include extension -- .bed/.bim/.fam) (REQUIRED)
   # Note: The add-in will search for a BED/BIM/FAM file trio that has this name in the 'PLACE_Target-Ref_Datasets_HERE' directory within ./Odyssey/PopStratModule/
	RefDataset="1000Genomes_Complete";


# Specify the Name of your Target Dataset (don't include extension -- .bed/.bim/.fam) (REQUIRED)
   # Note: The add-in will search for a BED/BIM/FAM file trio that has this name in the 'PLACE_Target-Ref_Datasets_HERE' directory within ./Odyssey/PopStratModule/
	TargetDataset="Plates1-48_Raw";


# Specify a Name For the PCA Analysis (must not include any spaces) (REQUIRED)
   # The specified PCA analysis folder can be found within ./Odyssey/PCA_Analyses/
	PCA_Analysis_Name="EyebrowsPCA";


# To determine the number of principal components to keep the R analysis script looks at how much each Principal Component contributes to the total amount
   # of variance. Currently, principal components that contribute 1% or greater to total variance is kept. In turn the Principal Component's dimmension is 
   # used in the calculation of the N-dimmension reference centroid, which forms the basis on what individuals are kept/removed due to outlying ancestries (OPTIONAL)
	PC_VariancePerc="0.01";
	PC_StandardDev="3";


# Maximum Memory Allocation
   # Some Plink Commands (especially when handling larger datasets) try and allocate large amounts of memory
   # Specify the maximum memory allocation you can dedicate (this will be used to limit Plink's memory allocation and the amount of memory R will be allowed if executing on a HPS
   # Specify in terms of GB
	Max_Memory="24";

# ===========================================================================================================================================================================
# ==================================================================== Program Dependencies =================================================================================

# Specify Path to Plink Exec: (REQUIRED)
	PlinkExec="/gpfs/home/r/y/ryeller/Carbonate/Programs/Plink_1.09/plink";

# Set R Bin Directory: (REQUIRED for PCA Analysis/Visualization) -- see R installation instructions below for some tips to getting R and its package dependencies installed
	# Put the path directory to the "bin" folder that contains your R.exe file
		Rscript="/gpfs/home/r/y/ryeller/Carbonate/Programs/R/R-3.5.1/bin/Rscript";


# ==================================================
#   00_PopStrat Script Step Control
# ==================================================

# Step 1: Extract Variant Names from Bim? (boolean: T/F) (OPTIONAL)

# Step 2: Attempt Merger of 2 Compatible Datasets? (boolean: T/F) (OPTIONAL)
	AttemptMerger="F";

# Step 3: Troubleshoot Merger by flipping the Custom Dataset, Remerging, then Removing Remaining Problem SNPS? (boolean: T/F) (OPTIONAL)
	FlipTarget="F";

# Step 4: Prune Dataset to Not Include Those in high LD? (boolean: T/F) (OPTIONAL)
   # NOTE: Plink Operation for This Step is: --indep-pairwise 1500 150 0.4
	PrepData="F";

# Step 5: Perform PCA on Pruned Merged Target-Ref Dataset? (boolean: T/F) (OPTIONAL)

#  R Installation Additional Help
# ====================================================
	# You will need to download and install the programming language R (plus some of its package dependencies) if you intend to use the visualization features of Odyssey
	# To download a local installation of R in cases where you don't have admin privileges you should be able to execute the following command on terminal (remember to remove the #):
		# NOTE: Change the --prefix file path to the directory you want R installed. This will cause R to be installed to a local directory (that you ideally have admin privaleges over)
			# wget http://cran.rstudio.com/src/base/R-3/R-3.5.1.tar.gz; tar xvf R-3.5.1.tar.gz; cd R-3.5.1; ./configure --prefix=/gpfs/home/r/y/ryeller/Carbonate/Programs/R; make && make install
	
	# You will also need to install the R package dependencies: tidyverse, qqman, manhattanly, data.table
		# You can do that by calling the R exec in terminal (R should then load) and then execute the following commented out lines
		
	#if(!require(tidyverse)) {install.packages('tidyverse', dependencies=T, repos='https://ftp.ussg.iu.edu/CRAN/', lib ='/gpfs/home/r/y/ryeller/Carbonate/Programs/R/R-3.5.1/library')}
	#if(!require(data.table)) {install.packages('data.table', dependencies=T, repos='https://ftp.ussg.iu.edu/CRAN/', lib ='/gpfs/home/r/y/ryeller/Carbonate/Programs/R/R-3.5.1/library')}
	#if(!require(ggplot2)) {install.packages('ggplot2', dependencies=T, repos='https://ftp.ussg.iu.edu/CRAN/', lib ='/gpfs/home/r/y/ryeller/Carbonate/Programs/R/R-3.5.1/library')}
	#library(tidyverse, qqman, manhattanly, data.table)

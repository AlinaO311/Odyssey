# Merge.conf File
# -------------------

# This configuration file will help you set the variables for the Custom Ref Panel Creator Add-in. 
# Note that some of these variables may not need to be changed as they are already set to various programs' recommended defaults. 
	# Changing these variables are thus optional and labeled as: "(OPTIONAL)"
# However, some of these variables (such as reference panel names) must be set by the user for the add-in to function
	# Changing these variables are thus required and labeled as: "(REQUIRED)"

# Be sure that all necessary variables are filled out before executing the script
# ====================================================


# ===========================================================================================================================================================================
# ============================================================= General Setup Variables =====================================================================================
# ===========================================================================================================================================================================

# Location of Where Odyssey Directory is Located: (REQUIRED)
	WorkingDir="/N/dc2/scratch/ryeller/Odyssey/";
	
# Name Your Merged Reference File: (REQUIRED)
	MergedRefName="HRC-1KGen";	


# Does your system utilize Lustre Stripped Directories? (OPTIONAL)
	# Lustre stripping helps the file directories on HPS to prevent from being filled by distributing the files between harddrives
	# This is a good practice to use if available since it prevents "drive-full" errors
	# If you don't know what this is or your system doesn't utilize this feature you can safely ignore this option
	# Boolean Specify (T/F):
		LustreStrip="T";
		
		
# Maximum Memory Allocation: (REQUIRED)
	# Many of the later steps (especially for the GWAS Project) use a larger amount of memory (in comparison to the Imputation Project Steps)
	# Specify the maximum memory allocation you can dedicate (this will be used to limit Plink's memory allocation and the amount of memory R will be allowed if executing on a HPS
	# 
	# Specify in terms of GB
		Max_Memory="70";

		
# HPS Max Walltime for Merging Reference Panels: (REQUIRED)
	# If submitting to a HPS you may have to specify your max walltime.

	# Specify in terms of DD:HH:MM:SS
		Walltime="1:10:00:00";	

		
# Enter Your Email to get Notifications from your HPC: (OPTIONAL)
	Email="ryeller@iupui.edu";

# ===========================================================================================================================================================================
		
# Toggle to Impute/Merge Reference Panels 1 and 2?
		MergeRefPanels="F";

# Control which chromosome imputation/merging scripts are created/executed:  (OPTIONAL)
	# Since some HPC's have limits on jobs submitted you may want to impute/merge ref panels in batches
		ImputeChrStart="24";
		ImputeChrEnd="24";		

		
# X Chromosome Reference Panel Merging
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Toggles whether the X chromosome (Chr23) is Imputed:
  # Boolean Specify (T/F):
	ImputeX="F";

# X Chromosome Identifier -- Reference directories are searched for the X chromosome map, legend, and hap files: 
	# Filenames will be searched based on the XChromIdentifier variable (specified below -- not case-sensitive)
		# Files will be identified by searching for the XChromIdentifier and "map",".legend.gz", and ".hap.gz"
			# For example, if XChromIdentifier = "NONPAR" then Odyssey will search for the map file by looking for "NONPAR" and "map" in any order
	XChromIdentifier="NONPAR";
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------

# Toggle to execute the imputation/merging scripts after you create them:
	# WARNING: Executes the scripts that were created in the Scripts2Merge Folder
	# Boolean Specify (T/F):
		ExecuteRefMergeScripts="F";
		
# Are you using a HPS (High Performance System) that utilizes a job handler?
	# If you specify "T" then a PBS header will be included on the Ref merging scripts
	# If you specify "F" then only a Bash shebang will be included on the Ref merging scripts
		HPS_Submit="T";	
	
# ========================================================================================================================================
# ============================================================= Error Analysis Toggle ====================================================
# ========================================================================================================================================
	
# Perform Error Analysis on Merged Reference Panel Files?
	# Will output the record of the completed merged reference panel file segment/s who has/have 'Killed' or 'error' output to their log files
	# Boolean Specify (T/F):	
		ErrorAnalysis="F";
	
# =========================================================================================================================================
# ================================================= Follow Up Concatenation of Merged Panel Segments ======================================
# =========================================================================================================================================
	
# Concatenate the merged reference panel segments .legend and .hap files into single chromosomal .hap .legend files
	# Boolean Specify (T/F):
		ConcatRefPanels="T";

# --------------------- Parallel Processing Option ---------------------# 
		# If you have GNU Parallel Installed (or available as a HPS module like on our system) you can speed up considerably the concatenation and analysis process
		# But if you don't mind waiting a little longer then you can skip this section and concatenate in serial
			# If you are wanting to deal with the headaches of parallel processing then it is assumed that you know your way around configuring GNU-Parallel
			# For convenience GNU-Parallel may be loaded by modifying the "LOAD_PARALLEL" variable
			# For example GNU-Parallel is currently setup to load via a module since our HPS uses module (http://modules.sourceforge.net/man/module.html)
			# However, you could easily use the SET command to set an environment variable that is directed to the GNU-Parallel exec files via (e.g. SET PATH=%PATH%;/path/to/other/exec)
			# Or if you would like more control configuring to your system then you will need to modify 3b_ConcatenateSegments.sh
				# Since line numbers change with updates, I've placed a "GNU-Parallel Tag" that you can search for in a text browser to find the lines you that load GNU-Parallel in 3b_ConcatConvert.sh
					LOAD_PARALLEL="module load gnu-parallel";
				
		# Boolean Specify (T/F): (IF set to "F" then will run in Serial Mode)
			
		# Concatenate the .gen files in parallel
			ConcatParallel="T";

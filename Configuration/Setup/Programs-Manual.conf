# Load GNU-Parallel (Optional):
	# To considerably speed up some of the later steps in Odyssey you can invoke parallel jobs via GNU-Parallel
	# GNU-Parallel thus must be enabled on the host computer (i.e. if you type 'parallel' into terminal and it runs GNU-Parallel, then you are set). For some systems GNU-Parallel must be loaded into the working environment. Thus, I provide the following variable that scripts use to call/GNU-Parallel if necessary. If typing 'parallel' into terminal already runs GNU-Parallel, you may safely skip this variable and enable parallelization within the 3b_ConcatConvert.sh script
		LOAD_PARALLEL="";

#  R Installation Additional Help
# ====================================================
	# You will need to download and install the programming language R (plus some of its package dependencies) if you intend to use the visualization features of Odyssey
	# To download a local installation of R in cases where you don't have admin privileges you should be able to execute the following command on terminal (remember to remove the #):
		# NOTE: Change the --prefix file path to the directory you want R installed. This will cause R to be installed to a local directory (that you ideally have admin privaleges over)
			# wget http://cran.rstudio.com/src/base/R-3/R-3.5.1.tar.gz; tar xvf R-3.5.1.tar.gz; cd R-3.5.1; ./configure --prefix=/gpfs/home/r/y/ryeller/Carbonate/Programs/R; make && make install
	
	# You will also need to install the R package dependencies: tidyverse, qqman, manhattanly, data.table
		# You can do that by calling the R exec in terminal (R should then load) and then execute the following commented out lines
		
	# if(!require(tidyverse)) {install.packages('tidyverse', dependencies=T, repos='https://ftp.ussg.iu.edu/CRAN/', lib ='/gpfs/home/r/y/ryeller/Carbonate/Programs/R/R-3.5.1/library')}
	# if(!require(qqman)) {install.packages('qqman', dependencies=T, repos='https://ftp.ussg.iu.edu/CRAN/', lib ='/gpfs/home/r/y/ryeller/Carbonate/Programs/R/R-3.5.1/library')}
	# if(!require(manhattanly)) {install.packages('manhattanly', dependencies=T, repos='https://ftp.ussg.iu.edu/CRAN/', lib ='/gpfs/home/r/y/ryeller/Carbonate/Programs/R/R-3.5.1/library')}
	# if(!require(data.table)) {install.packages('data.table', dependencies=T, repos='https://ftp.ussg.iu.edu/CRAN/', lib ='/gpfs/home/r/y/ryeller/Carbonate/Programs/R/R-3.5.1/library')}
	# library(tidyverse, qqman, manhattanly, data.table)
